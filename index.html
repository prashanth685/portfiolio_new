      <h1>As a Software Developer</h1>
      <h2>Sarayu Infotech Solutions Private ltd</h2>
      <p>
        Currently developing a real-time Vibration Monitoring System utilizing
        the MQTT protocol for efficient and lightweight transmission of sensor
        data from edge devices. Incoming data is processed through a Node.js
        backend, stored in MongoDB, and served to a React.js frontend for live
        plotting using charting libraries (e.g., Chart.js/D3.js/trading view).
        Implemented threshold-based anomaly detection logic to trigger instant
        user alerts (e.g., email/SMS/notification) when critical vibration
        levels are exceeded. Entire system is built on the MERN stack, ensuring
        seamless integration, high performance, and scalability across
        industrial use case.
